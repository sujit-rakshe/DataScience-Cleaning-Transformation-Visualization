# DataScience-Cleaning-Transformation-Visualization
"Data science tasks covering data cleaning, transformation, and visualization."

Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic data science skills, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, using the IRIS dataset from Kaggle. The main goal is to practice data preprocessing techniques and visualization, with GitHub for version control.

Objectives
1. **Task 1: Data Cleaning** - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, detect and handle outliers, and normalize features to prepare the dataset.
2. **Task 2: Data Transformation** - Perform data transformations such as encoding categorical variables, feature engineering, and aggregations to enhance data quality.
3. **Task 3: Data Visualization** - Create various data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze trends and relationships in the data.

## Project Structure
- **Task1-DataCleaning.ipynb**: Notebook with data cleaning steps, handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Task2-DataTransformation.ipynb**: Notebook covering data transformations, encoding, feature engineering, and aggregations.
- **Task3-DataVisualization.ipynb**: Notebook with visualizations, including histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, pair plots, and more.

## Instructions for Use
To run these notebooks, ensure you have Python installed with the necessary libraries:
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Running the Notebooks**: Open each notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute the cells sequentially.
